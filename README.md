# Weather Forecast Dashboard

This project is a **Weather Forecast Dashboard** developed using **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Requests**. The application interacts with a **RESTful API** sourced from **OpenWeatherMap**, showcasing my ability to work with web APIs and demonstrate data visualization skills. While the frontend design is minimal due to the technical nature of the target users, the functionality is robust and user-friendly.

## Features
- **City Input**: Users can enter the name of the city they wish to retrieve weather data for.
- **Forecast Duration**: A slider allows users to select the number of days (1 to 5) for which they want to view the weather forecast.
- **Data Selection**: Users can choose between viewing temperature data or sky conditions for the selected days.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. You can access the live version [here](https://arianesouza-weather-api.streamlit.app/).

## Data Source
The weather data is sourced from **OpenWeatherMap**, utilizing a token for access. 

## Skills Demonstrated
- **API Integration**: Successfully integrating and querying a RESTful API.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive plots using Plotly.
- **Web Application Development**: Building a functional web application with Streamlit.

Feel free to explore the dashboard and experience the functionality for yourself!
